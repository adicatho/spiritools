# SpiriTools – Catholic AI

**A 100% local, open-source, faithful Catholic theological assistant**

**SpiriTools** is the artificial intelligence branch of the long-standing **Ictus Win / Biblia Clerus** project (serving the Church for over 20 years).

It is a **large language model (LLM)** specifically trained on:

- Sacred Scripture (Vulgate, Neo-Vulgate, ancient versions)  
- Scholastic and medieval theology (St Thomas Aquinas, St Bonaventure, Gratian, etc.)  
- Contemporary Magisterium (councils, catechism, encyclicals)  
- Carmelite spirituality and the great mystics  
- Analytical dictionaries and **more than 600,000 validated cross-references**

## Key Features

- **100% offline** – works without any internet connection  
- **Zero reference hallucination** thanks to our advanced Ictus Win engine 
- **Natively multilingual**: French, Latin, English, German, Spanish…  
- **Fully open-source** – AGPL-3.0 licence  
- **Inference engine**: **PasLLM** (pure Object Pascal, extremely lightweight)  
- **Lightweight** – runs on ordinary computers  
- Planned integration into the next desktop version of Ictus Win
- Potential stand-alone Open Source version - maybe Web

## Goal

To provide a **trustworthy theological assistant** that:

- always quotes the original text with precise references  
- automatically connects passages using the millions of existing cross-references  
- can be used in monasteries, missions, seminaries, or at home – even without internet

This is **not** just another “Catholic ChatGPT”.  
It is the **faithful digital continuation** of Ictus Win, at the service of the intelligence of faith.
